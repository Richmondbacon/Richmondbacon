Im a computer science major graduating in 2027

## My favirote CPSC 120 lab

* Lab 12 part 1

  This was my favorite lab because it was both challenging and engaging. I particularly enjoyed tackling the difficult aspects of the tasks. The animation programming was especially fun and rewarding to work on.

* Lab 1

 This lab is my second favorite because it was the first thing I ever programmed. I found the experience incredibly exciting and Ill remember it forever. It was super cool to see my work come to life through programming.

* Lab 9 

  This lab is my third favorite for a reason similar to Lab 1. It really highlighted how much progress Iâ€™ve made since I started programming. The experience was incredibly memorable and meaningful to me.
