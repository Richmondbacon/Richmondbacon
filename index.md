Im a computer science major graduating in 2027

## My favirote CPSC 120 lab

Lab 12 part 1

This was my favirote lab because it was super difficult and I liked the animation programming

Lab 1

This lab is my second favirote because it was the first thing i ever programmed and i found it suber cool

Lab 9 

This lab is my third favirote for a similar eason to lab 1 but it really showed me how far Ive come and it was super memoriable to me
